<pre><code>    a. I can eventually access these applications <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> online resources, <span class="hljs-keyword">but</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> actual methods <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> access are spread out (e.g. different pages, windows, links, files, etc.)

    b.  I can see <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> talk <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> peers, <span class="hljs-keyword">but</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> sometimes difficult <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> collaborate <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> communicate freely <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> chat <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> online document editors are limiting <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> lack certain creative functionality <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> would be present <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> a face-<span class="hljs-keyword">to</span>-face setting

    c.  Even though I’m talking <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> peers <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> breakout rooms; <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span>’s hard <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> connect <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> them. The social aspect <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> classroom isn’t there <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> everything <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> restricted <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> academic activity.

<li><strong>Compare</strong> (the outcome with the goal)</li>

<pre><code>    a. Trying <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> access the various, dispersed online platforms results <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> frustration <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> some delay <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> the user

    b.  Collaboration <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> made difficult <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> the user <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> the <span class="hljs-keyword">group</span> cannot access the software <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">order</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> communicate <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> a timely manner, which can lead <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> delays <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> turning <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> assignments <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> possibly poor grades

</code></pre><p><strong>Identify your potential users.</strong>
Students, Teachers, Teleworkers, or just anyone that has to work remotely. From our experience, we found remote learning to be lonely and found it hard to remain collaborative. Our solution would help users socialize and make for a better learning/working experience.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-">Part 2:</h2>
<p>Other companies have already tried to solve these problems, particularly the combination of email and collaborative work tools, however there are not any existing solutions geared towards education besides zoom. There are over a hundred of these programs ranging in price and functionality, however, we have chosen four that claim to solve two of our three goals (1 collaborations, 2 consolidation, 3 socialize). </p>
<p>Slack- Slack is a program designed to make collaboration and team based communication easier. By combining video and messaging calls, email-like functions, and a “Workflow builder” function. 
    Microsoft Teams- Microsoft Teams seems to be the closest alternative to what we are shooting for by combining chat, video meetings, and collaborative functions such as file sharing.
Google Meet- Google Hangouts is another work optimization tool with a social twist. Hangouts is marketed as a way for friends to reconnect but is also used for businesses with G-Suite. Google hangouts has chat and room features as well as the ability to integrate other programs and apps.
Discord- Discord is generally marketed as good for video game messaging or social groups and incorporates test, audio, and video chat. Discord does not have work specific features but does support file sharing. Most notably, Discord encourages the social and community aspect of remote communication. </p>

<p><strong>Describe potential guidelines and solutions.</strong>
All of these existing solutions have some amount of pay-to-use functionality, whether it’s the entire program or an important part of the program. Additionally, they are all designed to be a collaborative meeting space that can be used independently of other applications, or have other applications integrated in with the solution as a base. Our solution would instead be an additional component to an existing ecosystem users are already familiar with. </p>
<p>These solutions also enforce that the user has an account for each barring access to those without. By creating a browser based system (no software download necessary) integrated into an existing learning commons like Brightspace, the need for additional registration and subsequent data collection is avoided. Some of the solutions discussed above such as Google Hangouts, and Microsoft Teams require you to have an account meaning an entire additional email for someone that may not already use these services. By now it’s probably likely that the average student has a Gmail account, Microsoft Outlook, Piazza, Learning commons, Zoom software, and many more. With our solution, we would cut the number of account registrations in half.</p>
<p>One thing that Discord brings to the table that other applications do not is the social aspect of work. We decided to compare discord for its successful social components such as sharing  gifs, images, and servers for the most serious and silly of topics despite its many work related downsides. By nature, in person school fosters social connection any number of ways be it class changes and bus rides, school recess, in person meetings and groups, or just physical proximity. We lose this feeling and community in the zoom work/school environment. No matter how hard we try to make things light, it can be hard to feel the same investment for something you aren’t experiencing. Microsoft Teams, Collaborate Ultra, Slack, and others market better performance, efficiency,  and productivity, but what about the subjective aspects of work? Self- satisfaction, community, and happiness. </p>
<h2 id="part-3-">Part 3:</h2>
<p><strong>Propose a solution.</strong>
Our solution is to create an eLC-like hub that incorporates all the functions of the various online platforms we use to complete our assignments and collaborate with peers, along with a “water-cooler” space that includes some games and provides a space for students to socialize virtually outside of the normal academic environment.
We would like our solution to be free as all of the existing solutions have some sort of “pay-to-use” functionality.</p>

<p><strong>How will you measure success?</strong>
Success can be defined by the number of users in relevant campus communities who prefer its use to other pieces of software. This can be measured either by the use of user surveys or through application analytics. Additionally,  success can be defined by the software’s portability.  Considering a key goal is to have the tool be seamlessly integrated into existing learning platforms, it stands to reason that it should integrate into any existing e-learning software solutions. </p>
