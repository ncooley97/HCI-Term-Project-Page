# Milestone 2:

## Part 1:
1.  **Goal** (form the goal)
    

	a.  Use online resources to complete assignments
    
	b.  Collaborate with peers on assignments
    
	c.  Interact with peers in a non-academic setting
    

3.  **Plan** (the action)
	  a.  Access the resources & Organize the resources
    
	b.  Work with peers
    
	c.  Talk to peers
    

4.  **Specify** (the action sequence)
	a.  Make sure internet and computer work then attempt to open the online resource
    
	b.  Use resources like Zoom, Piazza, and Google Docs to collaborate with peers
    
	c.  Interact with others in video chatting apps to work and socialize
    

8.  **Perform** (the action sequence)
    
	a.  Log into student/associated accounts to access applications
    
	b.  Log into Zoom, enter the Zoom ID & password, and join break out room, and open Google Docs or Piazza
    
	c.  Talk with my peers and discuss topics/themes that aren’t necessarily related to the assignments and tasks 	we are doing for classes
    

12.  **Perceive** (the state of the world)
    
	   a.  All of the resources I need to use are on separate platforms.
    
		b.  Once I get access to the Zoom meeting, I can collaborate with my peers
    
		c.  When I attend my classes virtually, I can talk to my peers and not feel isolated, but the socialization is mostly restricted to academic activity.
    

16.  **Interpret** (the perception)
    

		a. I can eventually access these applications and online resources, but the actual methods of access are spread out (e.g. different pages, windows, links, files, etc.)
    
		b.  I can see and talk to my peers, but it is sometimes difficult to collaborate or communicate freely as the chat and online document editors are limiting and lack certain creative functionality that would be present in a face-to-face setting
    
		c.  Even though I’m talking to my peers while in breakout rooms; it’s hard to connect to them. The social aspect of the classroom isn’t there as everything is restricted to academic activity.
    

20.  **Compare** (the outcome with the goal)
    

		a. Trying to access the various, dispersed online platforms results in frustration and some delay for the user
    
		b.  Collaboration is made difficult if the user and the group cannot access the software in order to communicate in a timely manner, which can lead to delays in turning in assignments and possibly poor grades
		
		c.  The user may be able to communicate with peers, but the interaction is very limited and lacks the casual feeling of a non-academic setting since the method of communication is typically used for academic purposes


**Identify your potential users.**
Students, Teachers, Teleworkers, or just anyone that has to work remotely. From our experience, we found remote learning to be lonely and found it hard to remain collaborative. Our solution would help users socialize and make for a better learning/working experience.

## Part 2:

Other companies have already tried to solve these problems, particularly the combination of email and collaborative work tools, however there are not any existing solutions geared towards education besides zoom. There are over a hundred of these programs ranging in price and functionality, however, we have chosen four that claim to solve two of our three goals (1 collaborations, 2 consolidation, 3 socialize). 

Slack- Slack is a program designed to make collaboration and team based communication easier. By combining video and messaging calls, email-like functions, and a “Workflow builder” function. 
	Microsoft Teams- Microsoft Teams seems to be the closest alternative to what we are shooting for by combining chat, video meetings, and collaborative functions such as file sharing.
Google Meet- Google Hangouts is another work optimization tool with a social twist. Hangouts is marketed as a way for friends to reconnect but is also used for businesses with G-Suite. Google hangouts has chat and room features as well as the ability to integrate other programs and apps.
Discord- Discord is generally marketed as good for video game messaging or social groups and incorporates test, audio, and video chat. Discord does not have work specific features but does support file sharing. Most notably, Discord encourages the social and community aspect of remote communication. 


| Application | Goals addressed | Pros | Cons |
|--|--|--|--|
| Slack | 1,2,3 | Easily organize conversations by project or topic; Has channels for social or “off-topic” conversations; High security/data protection | Channels interface is kind of confusing; Minimum file storage; Notifications are numerous and distracting |
| Microsoft Teams | 1,2 |Allows you seamless access to all other Microsoft tools and the integration of other apps; Transparency  | Must have a microsoft account; User complaints of too many emails and skype functionality is subpar |
| Google Meet | 1,2,3 | No time limit; Seamless integration into other Google tools like drive and docs; All cloud based collaboration | Must have a Google account; Maximum number of participants; Some multimedia documents are not supported |
| Discord | 3 |Free; very social and casual environment; Large file sharing; Privacy; Good video quality  | User reports of Lag depending on server location; Need a discord account; Only integrates with video games; Needs a Nitro subscription to share screen at 1080p or 60hz |
| Collaborate Ultra | 2 | Breakout rooms, polling tools, hand-raise, and all chat features; Don’t need an account to join meetings, integrates seamlessly into learning commons; Browser based (no software download) | Expensive; Can only see 4 videos or have 5 active microphones at once; Not very popular/ widely used |

**Describe potential guidelines and solutions.**
All of these existing solutions have some amount of pay-to-use functionality, whether it’s the entire program or an important part of the program. Additionally, they are all designed to be a collaborative meeting space that can be used independently of other applications, or have other applications integrated in with the solution as a base. Our solution would instead be an additional component to an existing ecosystem users are already familiar with. 

These solutions also enforce that the user has an account for each barring access to those without. By creating a browser based system (no software download necessary) integrated into an existing learning commons like Brightspace, the need for additional registration and subsequent data collection is avoided. Some of the solutions discussed above such as Google Hangouts, and Microsoft Teams require you to have an account meaning an entire additional email for someone that may not already use these services. By now it’s probably likely that the average student has a Gmail account, Microsoft Outlook, Piazza, Learning commons, Zoom software, and many more. With our solution, we would cut the number of account registrations in half.

One thing that Discord brings to the table that other applications do not is the social aspect of work. We decided to compare discord for its successful social components such as sharing  gifs, images, and servers for the most serious and silly of topics despite its many work related downsides. By nature, in person school fosters social connection any number of ways be it class changes and bus rides, school recess, in person meetings and groups, or just physical proximity. We lose this feeling and community in the zoom work/school environment. No matter how hard we try to make things light, it can be hard to feel the same investment for something you aren’t experiencing. Microsoft Teams, Collaborate Ultra, Slack, and others market better performance, efficiency,  and productivity, but what about the subjective aspects of work? Self- satisfaction, community, and happiness. 



## Part 3:

**Propose a solution.**
Our solution is to create an eLC-like hub that incorporates all the functions of the various online platforms we use to complete our assignments and collaborate with peers, along with a “water-cooler” space that includes some games and provides a space for students to socialize virtually outside of the normal academic environment.
We would like our solution to be free as all of the existing solutions have some sort of “pay-to-use” functionality.

| Affordances | Signifiers | 
|--|--|
| Centralized view | Interface hub with symbol-buttons for each button |
|Adding documents | Documents button|
| Joining video call | Join button |
| Login | Login button |
| Open document | Open  button |
| White board feature | White board button |
| Discussion board (persistent) | New Post button |
| Text chat | Chat button |
| Socialization outsiide of classwork | Playground button |




**How will you measure success?**
Success can be defined by the number of users in relevant campus communities who prefer its use to other pieces of software. This can be measured either by the use of user surveys or through application analytics. Additionally,  success can be defined by the software’s portability.  Considering a key goal is to have the tool be seamlessly integrated into existing learning platforms, it stands to reason that it should integrate into any existing e-learning software solutions.
