# Milestone 2:

## Part 1:
1.  **Goal** (form the goal)
    

	a.  Use online resources to complete assignments
    
	b.  Collaborate with peers on assignments
    
	c.  Interact with peers in a non-academic setting
    

3.  ** Plan ** (the action)
	  a.  Access the resources & Organize the resources
    
	b.  Work with peers
    
	c.  Talk to peers
    

4.  **Specify** (the action sequence)
	a.  Make sure internet and computer work then attempt to open the online resource
    
	b.  Use resources like Zoom, Piazza, and Google Docs to collaborate with peers
    
	c.  Interact with others in video chatting apps to work and socialize
    

8.  **Perform** (the action sequence)
    
	a.  Log into student/associated accounts to access applications
    
	b.  Log into Zoom, enter the Zoom ID & password, and join break out room, and open Google Docs or Piazza
    
	c.  Talk with my peers and discuss topics/themes that aren’t necessarily related to the assignments and tasks 	we are doing for classes
    

12.  **Perceive** (the state of the world)
    
	   a.  All of the resources I need to use are on separate platforms.
    
		b.  Once I get access to the Zoom meeting, I can collaborate with my peers
    
		c.  When I attend my classes virtually, I can talk to my peers and not feel isolated, but the socialization is mostly restricted to academic activity.
    

16.  **Interpret** (the perception)
    

		a. I can eventually access these applications and online resources, but the actual methods of access are spread out (e.g. different pages, windows, links, files, etc.)
    
		b.  I can see and talk to my peers, but it is sometimes difficult to collaborate or communicate freely as the chat and online document editors are limiting and lack certain creative functionality that would be present in a face-to-face setting
    
		c.  Even though I’m talking to my peers while in breakout rooms; it’s hard to connect to them. The social aspect of the classroom isn’t there as everything is restricted to academic activity.
    

20.  **Compare** (the outcome with the goal)
    

		a. Trying to access the various, dispersed online platforms results in frustration and some delay for the user
    
		b.  Collaboration is made difficult if the user and the group cannot access the software in order to communicate in a timely manner, which can lead to delays in turning in assignments and possibly poor grades
		
		c.  The user may be able to communicate with peers, but the interaction is very limited and lacks the casual feeling of a non-academic setting since the method of communication is typically used for academic purposes


** Identify your potential users.**
Students, Teachers, Teleworkers, or just anyone that has to work remotely. From our experience, we found remote learning to be lonely and found it hard to remain collaborative. Our solution would help users socialize and make for a better learning/working experience.

## Part 2:
 **TBD**


## Part 3:

**Propose a solution.**
Our solution is to create an eLC-like hub that incorporates all the functions of the various online platforms we use to complete our assignments and collaborate with peers, along with a “water-cooler” space that includes some games and provides a space for students to socialize virtually outside of the normal academic environment.
We would like our solution to be free as all of the existing solutions have some sort of “pay-to-use” functionality.

| Affordances | Signifiers | 
|--|--|
| Centralized view | Interface hub with symbol-buttons for each button |
|Adding documents | Documents button|
| Joining video call | Join button |
| Login | Login button |
| Open document | Open  button |
| White board feature | White board button |
| Discussion board (persistent) | New Post button |
| Text chat | Chat button |
| Socialization outsiide of classwork | Playground button |




How will you measure success?
You do not need to supply an evaluation for this milestone; however, you should discuss what criteria should be used to judge if your design is a success or not.
Success can be defined by the number of users in relevant campus communities who prefer its use to other pieces of software. This can be measured either by the use of user surveys or through application analytics. Additionally,  success can be defined by the software’s portability.  Considering a key goal is to have the tool be seamlessly integrated into existing learning platforms, it stands to reason that it should integrate into any existing e-learning software solutions. 

## Part 4:
