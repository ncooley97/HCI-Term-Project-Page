### Most Relevant User Stories and Their Justifications

**“As a student, I want to access all of my online learning resources in one location so that I may complete my assignments both efficiently and effectively.”**

* As we approach eight months since the start of lockdown in the US, more and more issues with remote work have begun to show face. For a typical class, a student would likely open eLc, Google docs, piazza, a course website or lecture slides, and of course Zoom. One issue that has come forth is the disjunctions of these interfaces. In our design, we sought to bring a version of these platforms to eLc In an effort to increase productivity, enhance collaboration, and preserve our sanity. In an article from Computer Economics, it’s suggested  this may be achieved via consolidation given, “Workforce productivity improves as there is less need for users to learn and work in as many different applications as they did before consolidation.” This user story is particularly important because it is a unique feature of our system as we seek to fight the “kudzu-like growth of applications within many organizations”.

**“As a student, I want access to a water-cooler space, so that I can socialize with my peers.“**

* There are a lot of reasons to be on edge right now. 2020 has seen unprecedented death, disease, and political division, and what’s worse? We are all processing it alone at home. This particular phenomenon has been getting lots of coverage lately as students, particularly young students, go back to school online. State News talked to teachers who reported students are experiencing “increased fatigue, headaches, lack of motivation, avoidance/procrastination, ineffective time management, feelings of isolation due to limited socialization in-person, minimized awareness and understanding of others created by in-person dialogues.” While we can’t fix the state of the world, in our system design we sought to create a space where students can relieve stress and socialize outside of class. This feature resembles a sort of “water-cooler” or “recess” space but virtual. Counselor Jessica Oyoke says, “Students are advised to practice self-compassion, self-care and forgiveness in such unprecedented times to take care of the mind.” For this user story we envisioned a social space where users can play games, chat, video call, and unwind with peers between classes.

* One issue that is not unique to remote school is collaboration online. Quick to be realized, collaboration is a multifaceted issue at the very core of remote work. What was once as easy as walking a desk over is no longer possible from home. While there are many possible solutions to remote collaboration, we decided to improve upon three specific designs: the whiteboard function, video breakout chatrooms, and discussion boards. In a Scholarly article titled “Facilitating Collaboration in online learning” the author explains how effective collaboration interfaces are important “so new ideas and knowledge can flow from group interaction. Creating common practices and common meanings is the cornerstone of collaborative practices.” We chose these three user stories because these features are most commonly used by professors and have room to improve. For the whiteboard and chat functions, the article suggests when facilitating collaboration online, “Provide means for faster feedback, e.g., establish ways for students to assemble synchronously or near synchronously (such as in chat rooms during set hours) for more immediate feedback sessions when most students can be present.” While these three stories tackle the same core issue, they go about it in different ways unique to our overall system. We chose to focus on all three because they represent the complete, effective collaborative interface we are hoping to create.

## Part 3

### Wireframe Justifications
1. **Content View**  This design was chosen to help consolidate many of the popular productivity and communication platforms (Zoom, Discord, Slack, Piazza, Teams, etc.) into a different yet familiar view in UGA’s eLC platform. As viewed from a standard 1920x1080 screen, eLC does not fully utilize the left and right side of the webpage. This design sought to maximize that unused space and incorporate those familiar elements of the platforms we use. The social aspect of the platform is important, so the sidebars allow easy access to various ways that facilitate communication and productivity: discussion and text boards, breakout rooms, lecture room, DMs to instructors and students, and the breakroom-type room. These elements in the UI are fixed while the inside content is scrollable. This keeps the elements easily accessible when browsing eLC. At the top-right, the user may search through the class discussion/text boards and course content. At the top (can pin to bottom) is a persistent toolbar that contains various tools to help productivity. Students can easily change their classview with the leftmost sidebar. We found some students did not like having to always scroll to access different functions, so this influenced many of the design decisions.
2. **Breakroom** The breakroom area takes over the main content view to break away from the learning content and promote social interaction. Here the game list is shown along with a large view of the room chat. Users can also toggle their camera and/or user gallery view on to visually interact with their peers. Entering a game replaces the main breakroom chat with the game chat so as to not flood the main chat; the main chat remains on the right sidebar so we don’t miss any conversation!
3. **Whiteboard** The whiteboard is simple and contains a button to invite others to collab on it. There are also buttons to change size, such as minimizing, resizing, moving, and popping out. These options allow the user to focus on other things while the whiteboard is in use.
4. **Breakout View** The breakout view is reminiscent of many video call apps. This view allows the user to become more familiar with their peers by providing a closer view of the user or their video camera. It helps remind that actual humans are behind the profile pictures. The gallery can change to speaker view when someone has priority in presenting something.
5. **Discussion Boards** students frequently have questions, so the discussion and text boards reside on the sidebar. Discussion boards allow students to easily ask and answer questions with a pop-out design that can be maximized should they want to focus on this function. The text boards serve as more persistent chat communications. This seeks to emulate something Piazza offers to students.

### Mockup Justfications


1. **Content View** We thought this design was best since it incorporated many familiar elements from popular platforms and thus provided easy understanding of the affordances of many of the elements present in the UI. This mockup UI uses a monochrome theme to reflect the class banner image on eLC. The top toolbar has some additional function1s. It has an add button that allows users to add shortcuts to places such as Content, Assignments, Grades, etc. so they do not have to scroll up to access these functions when deeper in the content view. The top bar also has tools such as screenshare, whiteboard, and collab documents. We felt the top was an intuitive location to house these tools. The bottom-left of the left sidebar contains more user-centric controls such as enabling the mic, the camera, or editing the eLC profile. The button designs were chosen as they seemed to be identifiable signifiers with affordances that would align to common user expectations.



2. **Breakroom** The Hangouts button is somewhat large and kept on the left sidebar to remind users that it exists, and a break is warranted every now and then. The breakroom is similar in layout to the wireframe. A user icon is placed on the top right to let users enable the gallery view to see their peers. The simplicity of the design lends to easy usage of it.

3. **Whiteboard** The whiteboard is placed on the top toolbar since the persistent nature of the bar allows users to open a collaborative whiteboard whenever they desire. As to not detract from the content they are already viewing, it only takes up a portion of the screen. Some more buttons offer varied affordances such as the paint brush for marking options and the wrench for whiteboard settings (color, etc.). Users can always minimize, maximize, resize, or move the whiteboard to let them concentrate on other tasks. This design offers most if not all the functions a user would expect in a whiteboard while enabling collaborative efforts.


4. **Breakout View** While in a breakout room, users can choose to focus on their content view or with users in the breakout room. A button on the bottom-left of the left sidebar maximizes a gallery view of users in the breakroom to easily see who is participating in the room. The user list on the right sidebar also expands to see any reacts or signals users want to display. Speaker view will change with whoever speaks, and those with elevated privileges such as instructors will always have priority speaker view. The design is like many video call apps to provide familiarity.


5. **Discussion Boards** The discussion board is reminiscent of a compact Piazza view. The pop-out design was chosen to not lose complete focus on the content view. Users can maximize or minimize the window should they want to focus on something on the post or elsewhere. Profile pictures are shown along with posts to easily identify users, and a reply button is shown on responses to let users follow a conversation within a post. The text boards are similar but more compact (bubble size) and do not allow replies, just posting.
