### A.2 - User Stories and Their Video Demonstrations 

#### “As a student, I want to access all of my online learning resources in one location so that I may complete my assignments both efficiently and effectively.”
Even though our design is valuable for teachers as well, we decided to focus on the student perspective for our user stories. This is only natural considering our relationship with online learning and how it has changed in the last nine months. In our ideation sessions, we were all quick to express frustration over the decentralization of the online tools we have come to know so well. We decided to build off the base already provided for us, and a familiar landscape for many schools with an online component. While eLc is not the world’s greatest technological feat, it does already have the infrastructure we were looking for and resembles other learning commons already in use. Plus, who wouldn’t want to redesign the bane of their already lived existence? For our design we took inspiration from familiar platforms such as Discord, Zoom, Slack, and Piazza for a familiar yet novel experience. This familiarity increases fluency and emphasizes our desire for a more social space granted in programs like Discord. 
    Fundamental to our design is the addition of two fixed sidebars, utilizing the entire standard screen size. This allows convenient access to assignments, discussion boards, chat functions, and documents without scrolling or searching. For users, we sought to tackle feelings of disorganization and redundancy by consolidating various online learning tools as well as a few additions of our own. 


#### “As a student, I want access to a water-cooler space, so that I can socialize with my peers.”

There’s a lot going through the head of students right now. They’re in the midst of a global pandemic that has brought unprecedented disease, economic shutdown, etc. To make matters worse, teachers have reported students experiencing increased fatigue, lack of motivation, and feelings of isolation due to limited in-person socialization. Our system design put a focus on developing a “water-cooler” space or “recess” space, so that students can socialize with one another. The water-cooler space will include things such as video games, video call, etc.

#### “As a student, I want to be able to access an online whiteboard so that my classmates and I can collaboratively diagram our assignments.”
An important asset to collaboration is the ability to express and process ideas and concepts visually. Text-based representation, while certainly very useful for both collaboration and communication, are limited in the amount one can express. Visual representation, e.g. drawings or sketches, can be much more effective and less limiting on the amount and kind of information that one can provide. Therefore, we found it necessary to include a feature to our interface that models the capabilities of a real-life whiteboard. With the collaborative whiteboard feature, working on assignments that require any sort of diagram or depiction will be much easier, especially during these times when meeting face-to-face in a classroom is difficult and ordinary classroom resources may be hard to come by. 

“As a  student, I want to have access to breakout group exclusive chat rooms for effective video call collaboration.”
A common concern for video conferencing collaboration is the effectiveness of breakout rooms. While this seems like a great idea, there are several issues that arise with the current design. We already discussed the availability of collaborative documents and whiteboards, but a room-specific chat room is an underrated improvement to video calls. Adopted from Collaborate Ultra, group exclusive chat rooms simultaneously create a private chat for your group while also minimizing distractions for others. The common zoom scenario of sending an off-topic, out of context chat to the entire class that was intended for your teammates is one of the inconvenient properties of Zoom we have come to expect. But, of course, a better design is possible. In addition to a full class discussion, each breakout room will have its own private chat. The design of the video call itself resembles Zoom and the functions are very familiar to those who have used the platform.

#### “As a student, I want to post to a discussion board so that other students can discuss and answer questions when they can.”

Despite the fact that eLc supports discussion boards, many professors, particularly in the CS department, use other programs such as Piazza. While they offer useful additions, it is another place to click, login, and check for content. Recognizing the faults of eLc’s discussion boards, we took cues from Piazza and Slack to improve the already incorporated feature. We decided to go with a pop-out design that can be expanded to fit the full content screen. Users can respond to posts and multimedia attachments are supported.



## Part B - Testing Protocol

### B.1 - Describe your research question and methodology

#### What is your research question?
Do users find our unified design to be more convenient and efficient compared to the existing structure?

#### Based on your research question, what methodology will you use for testing and why?

Our research will use a mixture of methods in order to gain insight into different aspects of our system. The first portion of our methodology involves **participant observation**. Participants will be sent the prototype along with a request to screen record themselves while using the system. This will allow for video evidence of every action the user takes while on the page, and will help demonstrate potential flaws, misconceptions, and areas of uncertainty in our design. The participant will be given a general outline of what is contained in the design, but no parameters will be placed on what they access or how much time they spend in the system. 


After the participant finishes interacting with the prototype, they will be asked to complete a short **survey**. The survey will contain statements about each of the features included in the prototype, and ask participants to indicate their opinion on each feature using a Likert Scale. Additionally, some questions will rate the prototype’s convenience and efficiency in comparison to tools like Piazza and Zoom in order to gage the effectiveness of our design. Finally, a suggestions box will be included at the end of the survey for participants to include any additional feedback they have about the usability and presentation of our design. 


### B.2 -  Based on the methodology you chose in (B.1), describe your testing procedure.

#### What is your specific plan to deal with informed consent?


In the initial email, participants will be informed of the intention of the study and be asked to confirm that by agreeing to participate they are consenting to have their screen be recorded and their survey results published. Additionally, all findings will be made publicly available after the testing protocol is complete so that participants may see the impacts of their experience on how our design is molded.  

#### What specific data will you collect and how will it be organized?

Participants will be asked to provide some demographic data about themselves, including UGA id, gender, age, and major. Additionally, they will be asked to rate their familiarity with similar tools such as Zoom, Piazza, Collaborate Ultra, Discord, etc. on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being “very familiar” and 1 being “not at all familiar.”  The data will be collected and stored in Qualtrics along with our survey results, because the platform is free for all UGA students to use. Qualtrics allows for easy design, distribution, and storage of surveys and is thus a valuable tool for our purposes. 

#### What type of analysis do you intend to to perform with the study data, and how will that analysis help answer your research question from (B.1)?

The Likert Scale survey questions will be divided into categories based on what part of the system is being addressed, and the results will be aggregated into an average for each category. This will allow us to easily gage how effective our design is at tackling our user stories, which will in turn allow for future prototypes to be updated based on common suggestions and complaints. Additionally, we will review the screen recordings and watch for any areas where our participants encounter issues accessing or interacting with specific portions of our design. The combined feedback from these two sources will allow us to accurately perceive if our design is more convenient and user-friendly than current classroom workflows.

#### How might you conduct your testing procedure safely during a pandemic?

All interactions will be entirely virtual. Students will receive invites to their emails, and all surveys and recordings will be handled electronically.
