# Milestone 4

## Part A - High Fidelity Prototype


## Part B - Testing Protocol

### B.1 - Describe your research question and methodology

#### What is your research question?
Do users find our unified design to be more convenient and efficient compared to the existing structure?

#### Based on your research question, what methodology will you use for testing and why?

Our research will use a mixture of methods in order to gain insight into different aspects of our system. The first portion of our methodology involves **participant observation**. Participants will be sent the prototype along with a request to screen record themselves while using the system. This will allow for video evidence of every action the user takes while on the page, and will help demonstrate potential flaws, misconceptions, and areas of uncertainty in our design. The participant will be given a general outline of what is contained in the design, but no parameters will be placed on what they access or how much time they spend in the system. 


After the participant finishes interacting with the prototype, they will be asked to complete a short **survey**. The survey will contain statements about each of the features included in the prototype, and ask participants to indicate their opinion on each feature using a Likert Scale. Additionally, some questions will rate the prototype’s convenience and efficiency in comparison to tools like Piazza and Zoom in order to gage the effectiveness of our design. Finally, a suggestions box will be included at the end of the survey for participants to include any additional feedback they have about the usability and presentation of our design. 


### B.2 -  Based on the methodology you chose in (B.1), describe your testing procedure.

#### What is your specific plan to deal with informed consent?


In the initial email, participants will be informed of the intention of the study and be asked to confirm that by agreeing to participate they are consenting to have their screen be recorded and their survey results published. Additionally, all findings will be made publicly available after the testing protocol is complete so that participants may see the impacts of their experience on how our design is molded.  

#### What specific data will you collect and how will it be organized?

Participants will be asked to provide some demographic data about themselves, including UGA id, gender, age, and major. Additionally, they will be asked to rate their familiarity with similar tools such as Zoom, Piazza, Collaborate Ultra, Discord, etc. on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being “very familiar” and 1 being “not at all familiar.”  The data will be collected and stored in Qualtrics along with our survey results, because the platform is free for all UGA students to use. Qualtrics allows for easy design, distribution, and storage of surveys and is thus a valuable tool for our purposes. 

#### What type of analysis do you intend to to perform with the study data, and how will that analysis help answer your research question from (B.1)?

The Likert Scale survey questions will be divided into categories based on what part of the system is being addressed, and the results will be aggregated into an average for each category. This will allow us to easily gage how effective our design is at tackling our user stories, which will in turn allow for future prototypes to be updated based on common suggestions and complaints. Additionally, we will review the screen recordings and watch for any areas where our participants encounter issues accessing or interacting with specific portions of our design. The combined feedback from these two sources will allow us to accurately perceive if our design is more convenient and user-friendly than current classroom workflows.

#### How might you conduct your testing procedure safely during a pandemic?

All interactions will be entirely virtual. Students will receive invites to their emails, and all surveys and recordings will be handled electronically.
