## Problem of Study
In discussing our critiques of remote work we identified three main issues we would like to solve.

1. Loneliness/isolation

2. Consolidation (i.e. Needing Piazza + eLc + Zoom + Google Docs)

3. Collaboration

To help combat these issues we have imagined a browser-based system that takes the functions of Zoom and [Collaborate Ultra](https://utlv.screenstepslive.com/s/faculty/m/54123/l/534959-collaborate-ultra-interface) into one place that can be added to any learning commons or remote classroom. To add a social element to this tool, we would like to add a "Water Cooler" or "Recess" function with the purpose of increasing social connection and simulating a class change or snack break where folks can take a much-needed moment off between video calls or assignments; we think productivity is just as important as trust and community in a classroom or work environment. Distractions can be a good thing.

By combining live video calls with learning commons and addressing issues of breakout collaboration like a whiteboard feature, in-session collaborative documents (like Google Docs for Zoom), and breakout group specific chat rooms we create a more effective in-class/meeting experience. And simultaneously, by adding a social feature that includes suggestions for ways to unplug and destress, small multiplayer games, and video chat with the purpose of relaxing, we create a more effective out-of-class/meeting experience.
